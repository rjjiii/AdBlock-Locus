# AdBlock-Locus
AdBlock Locus (ABL) provides a central point to enable and use K-Meleon's built-in adblocker (BAB). If you are using an older version of K-Meleon you will need to 
[download the BAB for older versions of K-Meleon](http://kmeleonbrowser.org/forum/read.php?9,135175) first. The BAB has no native GUI and needs an extension like AdBlock Locus to provide the GUI and subscription setup. ABL uses 3 separate subscriptions each tailored to older browsers like K-Meleo:

* Core: This is a small curated list of filter rules. The BAB needs a smaller list of rules to minimize slowdown. Core should only add a second or two to K-Meleon's launch time.
* Fallback: Many web pages are tested primarily against Google Chrome. K-Meleon's javascript handling is more secure but also older and stricter. Fallback will fix some web pages that have serious scripting bugs that cause them to break in K-Meleon.
* User: This is a local filter generated by ABL.
