# AdBlock-Locus

 AdBlock Locus (ABL) provides a central point to enable and use K-Meleon's built-in adblocker (BAB). K-Meleon is a light-weight, open-source web browser that still supports older platforms. It can run on Windows XP, on Windows Vista, without SEE, with low RAM, and in other conditions that common web browsers no longer support. The BAB has no native GUI and needs an extension like AdBlock Locus to provide the GUI and subscription setup. ABL uses 3 separate subscriptions each tailored to older browsers like K-Meleon:

* Core: This is a small curated list of filter rules. The BAB needs a smaller list of rules to minimize slowdown. Core should only add a second or two to K-Meleon's launch time.
* Fallback: Many web pages are tested primarily against Google Chrome. K-Meleon's javascript handling is more secure but also older and stricter. Fallback will fix some web pages that have serious scripting bugs that cause them to break in K-Meleon.
* User: This is a local filter generated by ABL.
